# Quartz-Oscillators-Temperature-Compensation
Bachelor's Thesis: Study, design, and analysis of quartz crystal oscillators and temperature compensation circuits (TCXO). Focused on frequency stability optimization and thermal drift mitigation techniques.


## Project Overview
This repository contains the work developed for my Bachelor's Thesis in Electronic Engineering at the University of Pisa. The project focuses on the fundamental role of **Quartz Oscillators** in modern electronics and the implementation of circuits designed to compensate for frequency drift caused by temperature variations.

## Key Technical Concepts
* **Quartz Crystal Stability:** Analysis of the piezoelectric effect and equivalent electrical models (Butterworth-Van Dyke).
* **Thermal Sensitivity:** Investigation of frequency-temperature characteristics (e.g., AT-cut crystals) and the impact of environmental factors on ppm stability.
* **Compensation Techniques:** * **TCXO (Temperature Compensated Crystal Oscillators):** Design of analog or digital compensation networks.
    * **VCXO Basics:** Using varactor diodes for frequency pulling in compensation loops.
* **Circuit Design:** Analysis of oscillator topologies like Pierce or Colpitts.

## Tools & Methodology
* **Mathematical Modeling:** Stability analysis and compensation curve fitting.
* **Circuit Simulation:** Validation of oscillator startup conditions and compensation network effectiveness (LTSpice).

## Repository Content
* `Design/`: Circuit schematics and compensation network layouts.
* `Analysis/`: Calculations and scripts for temperature curve fitting.
* `Docs/`: Thesis abstract and summary of the research findings.
